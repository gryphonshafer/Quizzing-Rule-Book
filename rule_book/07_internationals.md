# International Bible Quizzing

These rules apply to the *International Bible Quizzing* (IBQ) championship meet conducted annually, administered under the oversight of the *Christian and Missionary Alliance* (CMA) *Quizzing Leadership Team* (CQLT).

## Eligibility Requirements

All quizzers for IBQ competition must be 12 to 18 years of age at any point during the quiz season. Each quiz season begins on August 1 and ends on July 31.

In order to quiz at Internationals for a specific district:

- The quizzer must reside in that zone or in a bordering community
- Their home church must be from the zone in which they quiz

Any exceptions to this must be brought to the CQLT.

## Team Structure

Each district will be allowed to send as many teams as the district feels will be competitive and that they are financially able to send. These will be the district's international teams.

Each team must have a coach and may also have an assistant coach.

## Event Registration

All arrangements, promotion, and administration will be handled by the CQLT and the Life Office.

Notification by each district of its intention to enter a team must be received by the CQLT, on a form supplied by the CQLT, no later than the date posted on the CMA Bible Quizzing website. The names of the IBQ team, its quizzers, and its coaching staff, and all registration fees must be sent, when specified, to the Life Office for that quiz season. District participation fees for the current quiz season must be paid in order to register for the IBQ competition. Any exceptions to this must be brought to the CQLT.

## Selection of Officials

IBQ officials may include quizmasters, answer judges, scorekeepers, statisticians, and a meet director. IBQ officials will be appointed by the CQLT. To be considered for the CQLT appointment, all officials should:

- Be a regular church attender
- Have 3 seasons of district quizmastering experience and be recommended by their district office or quiz committee
- Go through an evaluation process established by the CQLT, to determine that each official is qualified to perform their specific role

When deemed necessary, any official may be replaced from their position during a meet by the CQLT. Team coaches whose teams are not involved in the quiz shall serve as answer judges and scorekeepers if needed.

### Scorekeeper

At least 1 scorekeeper will tabulate the results of each question on official scoresheets in every IBQ quiz. They shall keep a running score of each quiz. Points will be accurately tallied on individual quizzers for each team by statisticians appointed by the CQLT.

- Be responsible for keeping individual quizzers' scores
- Be responsible for keeping individual teams' scores
- Provide updates to the teams of their current standings

Statisticians shall not be a regular scorekeeper.

## Quiz Question Selection
