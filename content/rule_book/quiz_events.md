# Quiz Events

## Answer Duration

Prior to a quizzer's answer being correct or incorrect, quizzers may have up to 30 seconds to provide their answer.

### Logic

    Set the question answer duration to 30.

## Rulings

**Interchangeable**
: Interchangeable words are words that can be substituted for each other in an answer such that a quizzer will still be counted correct.

**Special Name**
: A name that imparts specific character qualities or attributes to that person of the deity

### Context Application

On all question types, a quizzer cannot automatically be ruled out of context by a single word, even if it is a unique word. Rather, the quizzer must say a complete thought or phrase that conclusively puts them out of context.

### Deity Rule

The correct person of the deity must be given. The quizzer may not move between persons of the deity when answering. Giving the name of a deity that is not correct is considered giving incorrect information.

If a quizzer refers to any person of the deity as either "God" or "Lord", these must be clarified by the quizzer within the question answer duration period when the text requires a more specific answer.

"Jesus" and "Christ" are interchangeable (but refer to the person of the Son) and the quizzer will be called correct.

If a pronoun is used in the text to name the deity, any of the names for that person of the deity within context may be considered an acceptable answer when clarifying. If the pronoun naming the deity is identified by the quizzer using a name that correctly identifies the deity, but with an identification that is out of context, the quizzer will be considered to have not stayed in context.

When there is a special name of the deity given in the text, the special name must be given in the quizzer's answer. If the quizzer states any other special names which are not in context, the quizzer will be considered to have not stayed in context, even if they refer to the same person of the deity.

When a quizzer gives other names for the same person of the deity, used within context, these should be allowed to be clarified within the question answer duration period when a more specific answer is needed.

#### Example

Examples of special names of a deity are:

- "The Lord God Almighty"
- "The Bread of Life"
- "Spirit of the Living God"

An example of special names that aren't in context, consider that Jesus refers to himself as "the bread of life" in John 6 and "the good shepherd" in John 10.

### Correct

The quizzer's response is correct when:

- It fulfills all requirements specific to the question type
- It contains the information requested
- The quizzer stays in context
- Mispronounced names are still recognizable as the answer

If the quizmaster did not complete the reading of the question, the quizzer's answer must include the information in the remainder of the question as well as the answer. The quizzer's answer must include all unique words in both the question and the answer.

Only the 1st response of the quizzer will be considered; however, if the response by the quizzer is in context and is not incorrect, the quizzer will be allowed their full question answer duration period to satisfy all requirements of a correct response.

**Quiz Out**
: 4 correct questions by the same quizzer in the same quiz

A quizzed-out quizzer may only jump on Bonus questions.

#### Example

Consider 1 Corinthians 3:6:

> I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making it grow.

Suppose an INT question was written:

> Who has been making it grow?

The correct answer is "God".

If a quizzer answered "Apollos", they have given incorrect information (even though the name "Apollos" is in context) and would be immediately called incorrect. If they had said "I planted the seed, Apollos watered it", they have not given any incorrect information, are in context, and will be given the full question answer duration period to supply the correct answer required.

### Incorrect

The quizzer's response is incorrect when:

- Incorrect information has been given
- The information given within the time limit is incomplete
- The response does not fulfill all requirements specific to the question type

**Error**
: An incorrect answer is also known as an error

**Err Out**
: 3 errors by the same quizzer in the same quiz

An error-out eliminates that quizzer from the quiz. The quizzer must leave the platform immediately.

## Challenges

Challenges exist so quizzers can contest rulings made by quiz officials. The team captain or co-captain may challenge if:

- There is reason to believe the quiz officials have applied the rule book incorrectly
- The quizmaster mispronounced a word
- The question is invalid

A challenge must be made at the time of the quizmaster's decision and before the next question's type is made known. If a timeout is called immediately after a ruling, and a quizzer stands to challenge, the challenge may be conducted prior to the timeout.

No conferring is allowed between the quizzer challenging and anyone else. Conferring with anyone else prior to a challenge will result in:

- The challenge being disallowed
- A foul being awarded to the quizzer

Once a team has requested an explanation of a ruling, and that explanation has been given, all teams lose the right to challenge. If an explanation of a ruling is requested, the quizmaster will ask if any team wants to challenge.

The result of a challenge may not be challenged.

If the challenge is accepted:

- Points or error points that reflect the new ruling of the judge will be recorded.
- A new question of the same number will be given if the question is ruled illegal.

When a challenge is made, the quizmaster must give each team's captain or co-captain an opportunity to speak to the challenge before making a ruling on the challenge. Whichever team is being challenged against will have the right to speak last.

## Protests

Coaches, including assistant coaches, of the teams participating in a quiz may place the quiz under protest under the following conditions:

- When a coach feels a logistical rule has been broken by the quiz officials
- When a coach feels a ruling on a challenge is incorrect

The protest must apply to the question or ruling that just occurred. The protest must be placed before the next question's type is made known. If a protest is launched after question number 20 is completed it must be done immediately after the ruling is announced.

The coach may only confer with their assistant coach and substitute quizzer, before protesting.

The quiz officials and quiz team coaches will meet privately and attempt to come to an agreement. If no agreement is reached within 10 minutes, the meet director will arbitrate and determine the just solution.

### Example

As an example of a logistical rule, consider a scenario wherein the quizmaster did not allow the full question answer duration period to expire for the quizzer when the quizzer was in context and had not given any wrong information.

## Fouls

A foul is a penalty called by a quiz official against a quizzer or team for conduct that breaks the text of spirit of the rules.

- Fouls may be called by any quiz official actively involved in the current quiz.
- A foul must be called before the quizmaster makes known next question's type.

The quizzer upon whom a foul is called becomes ineligible to jump on that question number, including any alphanumeric question numbers. The chair remains ineligible to jump on that question number, including any alphanumeric question numbers, even if the quizzer who committed the foul is substituted for.

If the officials fail to call a foul, a coach or captain may call it to the attention of the quizmaster. If in the officials' opinions a foul might have been committed, the quizmaster will give due warning to the violating team. A foul cannot be charged, and points cannot be deducted when the quizmaster receives such help from a coach or captain.

3 fouls by a quizzer eliminate that quizzer from the quiz. The quizzer must leave the platform immediately. That seat will continue to be ineligible to jump for the entire question number, including any alphanumeric question numbers.

The following are fouls:

- Team members (quizzers, coaches) communicating with each other, other teams, or with the audience between the time the question type is introduced, and points are awarded; communication can include non-verbal communication
- The use of the hands to assist in jumping; hands may not touch any part of the chair or the floor from the time "Question" is called until the quizmaster recognizes the 1st 1 up
- If any light goes on after the quizmaster calls "Question" and before they begin to discernibly read the question; discernibly includes the quizmaster's mouth forming a word shape
- During a Reference or Quote question, if any light goes on after the quizmaster calls "Question" and before they begin to discernibly read the chapter number
- Starting to answer before being recognized by the quizmaster
- Having more than the designated team members, 1 coach, and 1 assistant coach on the quiz platform during a timeout
- If a captain or co-captain confers with their coach or other quizzers prior to issuing a challenge; in addition, the challenge will not be allowed
- Infraction of the rules, in spirit as well as in the letter, as discerned by the quiz officials

**Individual Fouls**
: A foul awarded to 1 or more individual quizzers

**Team Fouls**
: The sum of individual fouls by members of the same team

**Foul Out**
: 3 fouls by the same quizzer in the same quiz

## Timeouts

Each team is allowed 2 60-2nd timeouts. Only 1 of those timeouts may be taken after question number 17, including any alphanumeric question numbers.

- Captains, co-captains, or coaches may call for a timeout.
- Only the coach, assistant coach, and substitute may converse with the team during a timeout.
- Timeouts may be called prior to bonus questions.

### Logic

    Set the timeout duration to 60.

## Substitutions

Substitutions may be made only during timeouts or to replace a quizzer who quizzes-out, errs-out, or fouls-out on the immediately preceding question.

- A team can only make 1 substitution per timeout.
- A quizzer being removed from a quiz must stay out for a minimum of 3 question numbers, including alphanumeric question numbers, before re-entering the quiz.
- Quizzers can be substituted for any chair.

Quizzed-out quizzers may remain in the quiz to answer bonus questions. Substituting for them afterward will require a timeout. If subbed-out, they may not return for any reason.

When a quizzer quizzes-out, errs-out, or fouls-out and leaves the platform after the event, a substitute may take their place immediately and without a timeout, even if the incoming quizzer has been subbed-out less than 3 questions ago.
