# Material and Questions

Bible Quizzing meets consist of a series of quizzes, which themselves consist of a series of questions. Questions are written based on a quiz season's material. Material refers to the Scriptural scope of content set for each season. The Bible edition used is the *New International Version* (NIV) 2011 edition of the Bible. There is an 8-season rotation of material. 4 are defined as "Narrative" and 4 are defined as "Epistle" in terms of a material's style.

**Question Type**
: Every quiz question is 1 of a particular set of question types, such as *Chapter Verse Reference* (CVR) and *Finish the Verse* (FTV).

**Question Type Group**
: Question types are part of 1 or more question type groups, such as Reference and Finish.

**Question Text**
: Every word required to ask a question

**Answer Text**
: Every word in addition to the question text required to answer a question perfectly

**Reference**
: Technically, the Scriptural reference for the verse or verses that contain the whole of the question text and answer text, excluding any pronoun clarifications or answers to SIT questions; practically, the Scriptural reference for the 1st verse with content from the question text, except in the case of questions of type Q2V, where both verses are the reference

**Written Question**
: All parts of a pre-prepared, written question including question type, reference, question text, and answer text

**Unique Word**
: A word appearing in only 1 verse in the material

**Unique Phrases**
: 2 or 3 consecutive words appearing in only 1 verse in the material

**1st 5 Words of the Question**
: The 1st 5 words of the question text that are from the material and the interrogative word

### Interrogative Words

Interrogative words are the single interrogative word that must be inserted at either the beginning or the end of every question text requiring such. Question type groups that require interrogative words are:

- Interrogative
- Multiple Answer
- Reference

The exhaustive list of interrogative words is:

- Who
- Whom
- Whose
- What
- Why
- Where
- When
- Which
- How

### Context

Context is a range of verses from the question's reference. Context is a concept primarily related to the answering of questions, but it needs to be considered when writing questions from the material. By default, context is limited to 5 verses before or after the reference; however, some question types have a different context, which is defined in the question type.

## Question Writing

### Preparation of Questions

All questions must contain verbatim material.

The only exception to this is SIT type question quotations, which could potentially involve a single quotation, broken up by non-quotation words. This would result in the SIT quotation being written without the non-quotation words in the middle of the 2 quotations.

On some question types, the addition of a single, approved, interrogative word at the very beginning or very end is required.

### Question Types

#### Interrogative (INT)

Interrogative questions, also called standard, regular, normal, general, and straightforward questions:

- Must have exactly 1 inserted interrogative word at the very beginning of the question or the very end of the question
- Must have a single answer
- Must include a unique word or a 2 or 3-word unique phrase within the 1st 5 words of the question

#### Multiple Answer (MA)

- Must meet all the requirements of an INT except for the single answer requirement
- Must have more than 1 answer
    - The clarification of a single answer does not meet the above requirement
    - The identification of a single pronoun does not meet the above requirement
    - The identification of a plural pronoun, with more than 1 clarification to the pronoun, does meet the above requirement

In addition, an MA question is invalid if 1 of the listed answers to the multiple answer's questions is a "negative" answer. A "negative" answer is an answer used to contrast another answer or an answer that does not answer the question, such as an answer that begins with the words or similar words to "not" or "neither".

##### Examples

For an example of a negative word, consider 1 Corinthians 3:7:

> So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.

The question "Who is anything?" would require the answer:

> Neither the one who plants nor the one who waters.

This is an invalid MA.

Consider 1 Corinthians 9:25:

> Everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training. They do it to get a crown that will not last, but we do it to get a crown that will last forever.

The question "A crown that will what?" with an answer "Not last; last forever" is an invalid MA.

#### Reference

Reference question type group questions are used to distinguish between exact duplicate words or phrases from the material. The entire reference question is part of the required question and answer.

If a quizzer needs to provide the reference question, the provided reference question must:

- Be of the exact same question type (CR, CVR, MACR, MACVR) as the written question
- Have content and wording similar to the content and wording of the written question

Only the material is used, not the choice of interrogative word, when deciding whether a question is an INT versus CR versus CVR.

##### Examples

As an example of similar content and wording, consider Luke 23:37:

> and said, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself."

A CVR question could be written: "According to Luke, chapter 23, verse 37, King of what?" The answer would be: "The Jews." A quizzer could provide a question of "King of what?" or "King of whom?" as Jews could be referring to either a nation (a "what") or a people (a "whom"). In this case, the quizzer could also provide, "King of the what?"

As an example of referencing the determining word or phrase, consider 2 Peter 2:8:

> For that righteous man, living among them day after day, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard.

A CR question could be written: "What deeds?" The answer would be: "Lawless." If the quizzer provided the question, "Lawless what?" the quizzer would be incorrect because the quizzer's question and the written question are not similar.

##### Commentary

If 2 identical phrases exist in the same chapter, but 1 occurrence grammatically calls for use of the "who" inserted interrogative word, and the other occurrence grammatically calls for the use of the "what" inserted interrogative word, that difference in the grammatically dictated interrogative word does not change the fact that the phrase from the material (that excludes the inserted interrogative word) occurs more than once in the same chapter, necessitating a CVR question.

The above does not mean that if the quizzer needs to provide a reference question that is a CVR, and their choice of interrogative word changes the question type to MACVR, that the quizzer has given a valid CVR. In this case, the validity changes based on the interrogative word because of how the required answer changes.

##### Chapter Verse Reference (CVR)

- Must have a single answer
- The question must contain a word or phrase that exists in more than 1 verse in the same chapter
- Context is the single verse

The question text should be in the form:

> According to [book name], chapter [chapter number], verse [verse number], [remainder of question text]

##### Chapter Reference (CR)

- Must have a single answer
- Must contain a word or phrase that exists more than once in the material and only once in the chapter

The question text should be in the form:

> According to [book name], chapter [chapter number], [remainder of question text]

##### Multiple Answer Chapter Verse Reference (MACVR)

- Must meet all the requirements of a CVR except the single answer requirement
- Must also meet all the requirements of a MA except the unique word or phrase requirement

##### Multiple Answer Chapter Reference (MACR)

- Must meet all the requirements of a CR except the single answer requirement
- Must also meet all the requirements of a MA except the unique word or phrase requirement

#### Quote/Finish

Quote and finish questions must be quoted word-perfect. Quizzers may go back and correct their answers if done in the question answer duration period. The quizzer will be required to make 1 full, correct rotation; however, the quizzer can be called correct without 1 full, correct rotation if they have made a mistake only in 1 area of the verse and correct the mistake, making it abundantly clear to the quizmaster and answer judge that they know where their mistake was and what the corrected words are.

Context is defined as the required verse, which is defined as the 1 or 2 verse range of the question, based on the question type.

##### Quote (Q)

- Must be 1 verse
- The entire reference is part of the question and therefore required in the response if not fully spoken by the quizmaster

The question text should be in the form:

> Quote [book name], chapter [chapter number], verse [verse number].

##### Quote 2 Verses (Q2V)

Q2V is used when a verse is not strong enough on its own and needs another verse to explain it or can be used when 2 verses combine to form an even stronger thought.

- Must be 2 consecutive verses
- The entire 2-verse reference range is part of the question and therefore required in the response if not fully spoken by the quizmaster

The question text should be in the form:

> Quote [book name], chapter [chapter number], verses [verse numbers].

##### Finish

- Finish questions have question text consisting of the 1st 5 words of material starting based on the question type. 
- These 1st 5 words must be unique to all possible finish questions of the exact same type; for example, FTV compared to all possible FTVs, FT to all possible FTs, F2V to all possible F2Vs, and FTN to all possible FTNs.
- Since the question text must have exactly 5 words, a valid FTV or FT must be six words or more total. Likewise, the full text of a FT2V or FTN must contain six or more words.

##### Finish the Verse (FTV)

- Begins at the beginning of a single verse and finishes at the end of that verse

##### Finish This (FT)

- Begins in the middle of a verse and finishes at the end of the verse
- Must start at the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of a quotation

##### Finish 2 Verses (F2V)

- Begins at the beginning of a verse and continues to the end of the next verse
- Used when a verse is not strong enough on its own and needs another verse to explain it or can be used when 2 verses combined, form an even stronger thought

##### Finish This and the Next (FTN)

- Begins in the middle of a verse and finishes at the end of the next verse
- Must start at the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of a quotation
- Used when part of a verse is not strong enough on its own and needs another verse (or part of a verse) to explain it or when 2 verses combined form an even stronger thought

#### SIT (SIT)

- Used only in the quiz season where the material type is narrative
- The question text contains 2 parts:
    - Up to 3 questions regarding the SIT of the quotation from the following interrogatives:
        - Who said it
        - To whom
        - How
        - Why
        - When
        - Where
        - About whom
    - Quotation
        - Must be a direct quotation from the material by a person or an entity
        - The quotation must not exceed 2 consecutive verses
        - The 1st 5 words must be unique to all quotations
        - The quizzer is not required to repeat the quotation word-perfect but must be substantially close without leaving out key components of the quotation
        - Must start at the beginning of a quotation or the beginning of a sentence within the quotation; when a SIT question comes from a quotation that runs for more than 2 verses, the beginning of the SIT question must start within the 1st 2 verses of the quotation

If the quotation is split-up by non-quotation words, the quotation will be read without the non-quotation words. A SIT question can combine 2 separate quotations as long as no words are added and the 2 quotes flow easily from 1 to another. The quotation must be written excluding any non-quotation words in the middle of the quotations.

The answer to the SIT question must be in context.

##### Example

As an example split-quotation SIT question, consider Matthew 4:19:

> "Come, follow me," Jesus said, "and I will send you out to fish for people."

A SIT question could be written:

> Who said it? "Come, follow me, and I will send you out to fish for people."

Answer: "Jesus."

### Invalid Questions

Questions must be declared invalid by the quizmaster or answer judge(s) if:

- The answer requires interpretation by the quizzer
- The question is ambiguous, tricky, or misleading
- The question is multiple-choice
- If the question is not answered

When a question is deemed invalid and thrown out, it must be replaced with the exact same type of question. For example, an MACVR must be replaced with an MACVR, not any multiple-answer reference question.

#### Example

To help illustrate more the idea of "if the question is not answered", consider a scenario where the question asks, "What is good?", and the answer states what is not good. In this case, the question is not answered and is tricky or misleading.
